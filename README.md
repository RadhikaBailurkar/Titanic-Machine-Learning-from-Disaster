# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Kaggle Machine Learning Competition

So recently I decided to try out my hand in Getting Started Competitions which were available ojn Kaggle. I have done some practice on Python language and also know some Machine Learning algorithms(not all!) and I made up my mind to enter this 'Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster' Challenge. To get a hang of how this challenge works and what is meant by an actual submission on the platform.
